# SMA-Epidemiology-C++
### Owner of this repository : Benjamin Antunes, PhD student at Limos.
### Working with Pr. David Hill (LIMOS).

This repository is based on the code : https://gitlab.isima.fr/beantunes/sma-covid-repro-en 

On this repository, we are testing the differences induces by the usage of different PRNG algorithms, and also comparing the two versions of the code : Sparse matrix vs full map.
The result is that we do not have any statistically significant differences.


In addition, we made a design of experiment to measure the impact most important parameters.
This is located in the folder : SMA-Covid-V2-ZZ3-MT-PlanExperience

Due to the large amount of of data, we were not able to store the data on the repository.
Data are stored at : https://sma-epidemiology-data.limos.fr/
